      At first glance the Ruby Gem project seemed like a great chance to take the training wheels off.  I had loved diving head-first into the labs and learning from all the mistakes I made (and make). Each mistake carries a lesson and makes the whole picture a clearer to me.  Little by little it comes into focus. But this felt different. I didn’t even know how to start this project. Literally. How do you even begin the process of setting up a program, I wondered? 
     So, while I sat in front of a blank screen, I went through the mental refactoring needed to remind myself that the actual content of the data collected mattered less than the practice of putting together a Ruby Gem. Things flowed more easily at that point. Now I could focus on the task at hand, writing code. However, I still wanted to do something at least tangentially related to my everyday life in case I wanted to build upon it in the future.  
     I looked around my immediate area. As API’s were a new concept to me and when I looked into local APIs, I was surprised to find just how common they are.  I live in Denver and a quick google let me know that the city maintains a ton of good APIs.  They even come in 6 different data formats. Everything from bike racks, to swimming pools, to an inventory of all the trees on city property.  There are currently 251 APIs from the city to be exact.  Without a doubt, there were great possibilities there. But a nagging part of me really wanted to use this project to get a better handle on web scraping. I’m not sure how much it’s used in the industry but if it’s used at all I’ll need a much better handle on it going forward.
     I’ve spent a lot of time at the local Denver Zoo the past few years with my son(now 8 years old), and I thought it would be great to have an app that provides quick access to information on the animals there.  The Denver Zoo has a great website that provides a lot of information, but I thought it could be handy to pare down that info a bit to what the user really wants.  So, I settled on a GLI GEM for the Denver Zoo.  
	   I’m happy to say that after the dust settled a I did get a greater understanding of Ruby and some general programming concepts. One of the problems with being new to a field is that you don’t even know what you don’t know.  I spent the better part of a day just setting up the structure of my program, something I had previously taken for granted in the labs. So much for diving right in, but I am grateful for the new knowledge gained.
